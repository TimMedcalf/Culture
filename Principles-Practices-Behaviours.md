# Practices #

### Test Driven Development ###

> _We value the practice of test-driven development_

If you don't write the tests first will you write them afterwards?

Produces testable code by default

### Pairing and Pair Programming ###

> _We value the practice of pair programming_

Pair programming is pro-active code preview not fail-safe code reviews

Pair programming should be done at the right time for the right reasons.

> _Pair programming does not involve pairing all day, every day_

Agree a pairing style and the scope of the work to be done when pairing

- [ ] **Rules defined**


### Work in small batches ###

> _We work in small batches_

small batches of work are easily verifiable, reduce risk and guide us towards continuous integration and delivery

Local Changes < 1 day old

### Code previews vs code reviews ###

> We always aim to verify our work before the last moment

Clarify Specification and validate solution outline

pair programming

### Continuous delivery ###

> _Our goal is continuous delivery_


Build quality in

Small changes mean issues can be detected and fixed cheaply

deliver measurable outcomes quickly

feedback early and often

# Trunk Based Development #

> _Trunk based development supports our efforts in continuous delivery and ensures we can always release_

We support longer term batches of work by using Feature Flags
and Branch by Abstraction

### Remote first ###

> _We support remote workers as first class participants in any activity they are part of_

A modern workforce should be enabled to work in a flexible way that supports their location and allows them an equal presence

### Spikes to clarify work ###

> _We use spikes to clarify feasibility and scope_

Spikes are never on Master

We only use spokes on work that relates to user value

### Mobbing ###

> _We support mobbing where significant technical exploration is required

#### Code Review ####

> _All of our code is reviewed_

This is not necessarily a PR related review. This could be through pairing or through separate validation of work undertaken by someone on their own. Small batches is the key to keeping this an efficient practice.
