# Practices #

## Test Driven Development ##

> **_We value the practice of test-driven development_**

If you don't write the tests first will you write them afterwards?

Produces testable code by default

## Pairing and Pair Programming ##

> **_We value the practice of pair programming_**

Pair programming is pro-active code preview not fail-safe code reviews

Pair programming should be done at the right time for the right reasons.

Pair programming does not involve pairing all day, every day

Agree a pairing style and the scope of the work to be done when pairing

- [ ] **Rules defined**

## Work in small batches ##

> **_We work in small batches_**

small batches of work are easily verifiable, reduce risk and guide us towards continuous integration and delivery

Local Changes < 1 day old

## Review early and often ##

> **_We always aim to verify our work before the last moment_**

Clarify Specification and validate solution outline

Use Pair programming

## Continuous delivery ##

> **_Our goal is continuous delivery_**

Small changes mean issues can be detected and fixed cheaply

deliver measurable outcomes quickly

feedback early and often

## Trunk Based Development ##

> **_Trunk based development supports our efforts in continuous delivery and ensures we can always release_

We support longer term batches of work by using Feature Flags
and Branch by Abstraction

## Remote first ##

> **_We support remote workers as first class participants in any activity they are part of_**

A modern workforce should be enabled to work in a flexible way that supports their location and allows them an equal presence

## Spikes ##

> **_We use spikes to clarify feasibility and scope_**

Spikes are never on Master

We only use spokes on work that relates to user value

## Architectural decision records (ADRs) ##
> **_We use architectural decision records as a way of capturing and communicating key decisions about our software architecture_**

## Mobbing ##

> **_We mob where significant technical exploration is required_**

## Code Review ##

> **_All of our code is reviewed_**

This is not necessarily a PR related review. This could be through pairing or through separate validation of work undertaken by someone on their own. Small batches is the key to keeping this an efficient practice.

# Principles #

## SOLID ##

> **_We value the SOLID principles of object oriented programming_**

**S**ingle responsibility principle

**O**pen-closed principle

**L**iskow substitution principles

**I**nterface segregation principle

**D**ependency inversion principle


## Clean Architecture Principles ##

> **_Our Architectural values are represented by Clean Architecture Principles_**

## Visualise work ##

> **_We visualise work so that it is transparent_**

## Flow ##

> **_We value the principles of flow in our teams where engineers can achieve a state of full focus_**

## Agile ##

> **_We value the principles of Agile_**

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

## Solve Problems with Code ##

> **_We arent afraid to throw work away or to write some code to help us solve a problem_**

## Architectural Fitness ##

> **_just like we measure our products to gauge success we measure our code and architecture to protect our code_**

## Make it easiest to do the right thing ##

> **_Always enable colleagues to make the right decision by making it the easiest decision_**

## Technology decisions are owned by chapters ##

> **_Key decisions on technology and its use are decided by chapters_**
