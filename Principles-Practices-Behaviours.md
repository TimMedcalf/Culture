# Practices #

## Test Driven Development ##

> **_We value the practice of test-driven development_**

If you don't write the tests first will you write them afterwards?

Test driven development produces testable code by default

## Pairing and Pair Programming ##

> **_We value the practice of pair programming_**

Pair programming is pro-active code preview not fail-safe code reviews

Pair programming should be done at the right time for the right reasons.

Pair programming does not involve pairing all day, every day

Agree a pairing style and the scope of the work to be done when pairing

- [ ] **Rules defined**

## Work in small batches ##

> **_We work in small batches_**

small batches of work are easily verifiable, reduce risk and guide us towards continuous integration and delivery

Local Changes < 1 day old

## Feedback early and often ##

> **_We always verify our work before the last moment_**

Clarify Specifications and validate solution outlines

Use Pair Programming for continuous review* 

## Continuous delivery ##

> **_Our goal is continuous delivery_**

Small changes mean issues can be detected and fixed cheaply

CD delivers measurable outcomes quickly

Feedback early and often

## Trunk Based Development ##

> **_Trunk based development supports our efforts in continuous delivery and ensures we can always release_**

We support longer term batches of work by using Feature Flags and Branch by Abstraction

## Remote first ##

> **_We support remote workers as first class participants in any activity they are part of_**

A modern workforce should be enabled to work in a flexible way that supports their situation and allows them an equal presence with other participants

## Spikes ##

> **_We use spikes to clarify feasibility and scope_**

Spikes are never on Master

We only use spikes on work that relates to user value

## Use Architectural decision records (ADRs) to cpature key decisions about of our architecture ##
> **_We use architectural decision records as a way of capturing and communicating key decisions about our software architecture_**

These shouldnt be treated like acceptance criteria

## Mobbing ##

> **_We find mobbing a valuable tool where significant technical exploration is required_**

## Code Review ##

> **_All of our code is reviewed_**

This is not necessarily a PR related review. This could be through pairing or through separate validation of work undertaken by someone on their own. Small batches is the key to keeping this an efficient practice.
but all code must be reviewed by someone other than the author 

# Principles #

## SOLID ##

> **_We value the SOLID principles of object oriented programming_**

**S**ingle responsibility principle

**O**pen-closed principle

**L**iskow substitution principle

**I**nterface segregation principle

**D**ependency inversion principle


## Clean Architecture Principles ##

> **_Our Architectural values are represented by Clean Architecture Principles_**

[Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)

## Visualise work ##

> **_We visualise work to share understanding_**

## Flow ##

> **_We value the principles of flow in our teams where engineers can achieve a state of full focus_**

## Agile ##

> **_We value the principles of Agile_**

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

## We Solve Problems with Code ##

> **_We arent afraid to throw work away or to write some code to help us solve a problem_**

## We use Fitness functions as a was measuring and reasoning about our evolving architecture ##

> **_just like we measure our products to gauge success we measure our code and architecture to protect our code_**

## Make it easiest to do the right thing ##

> **_Always enable colleagues to make the right decision by making it the easiest decision_**

## Technology decisions are owned by chapters ##

> **_Key decisions on platform specific technology and its use are decided by chapters_**

## We believe in total Quality ##

Quality From the start
Our quality standards are not negotiable

# Behaviours #

## We value transparency ##

> **_Transparency provides for a culture of trust and allows shared understanding_**

## We are inclusive by default ##

> **_We are equals as part of the same team_**

## Fairness and equality are paramount ##

## We value and support continual learning and development ##

> **_Self development and mastery is critical to our personal and mutual success_**

## We believe everyone is a coach ##Â 

> **_We help each other be our best through honest dialogue, advice and support _**
