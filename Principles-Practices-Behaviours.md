# Practices #


## Test Driven Development ##

Writing tests first avoids the challenge of whether you will write them afterwards?

Test driven development produces testable code by default

Test-driven development encourages client oriented design choices thinking from the perspective of a consumer which promotes better API

## Pairing and Pair Programming ##

Pair Programming allows upfront discussion of specifications and design decisions rather than relying on a review of already written code

Pair programming should be done at the right time for the right reasons - It doesn't involve pairing all day, every day

Agree a pairing style and the scope of the work to be done when pairing

## Work in small batches ##

Small batches of work are easily verifiable, reduce risk and support our goal of continuous integration and delivery

Local Changes < 1 day old

## Feedback early and often ##

Clarify Specifications and validate solution outlines continuously to avoid the only check being review once code is already written

Use Pair Programming for continuous review

## Continuous delivery ##

Small batches mean issues can be detected and fixed cheaply

CD delivers measurable outcomes quickly

supports our principle of feeding back early and often

## Trunk Based Development ##

Ensure code is always shippable

Support longer term batches of work by using Feature Flags and Branch by Abstraction

## Remote first ##

Remote workers are first class participants in any activity they are part of

A modern workforce should be enabled to work in a flexible way that supports their location and allows them an equal presence with other participants

## Spikes ##

We use spikes to clarify feasibility, viability and scope

## Use Architectural decision records (ADRs) ##

We use architectural decision records as a way of capturing and communicating key decisions about our software architecture

## Mobbing ##

> **_We find mobbing a valuable tool where significant technical exploration is required_**

## Code Review ##

> **_All of our code is reviewed_**

This is not necessarily a PR related review. This could be through pairing or through separate validation of work undertaken by someone on their own. Small batches is the key to keeping this an efficient practice.
but all code must be reviewed by someone other than the author 

# Principles #

## SOLID ##

> **_We value the SOLID principles of object oriented programming_**

**S**ingle responsibility principle

**O**pen-closed principle

**L**iskow substitution principle

**I**nterface segregation principle

**D**ependency inversion principle

## Done means Done ##

> **_We only hand-off code that is shippable_**

## Clean Architecture Principles ##

> **_Our Architectural values are represented by Clean Architecture Principles_**

[Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)

## Visualise work ##

> **_We visualise work to share understanding_**

## Flow ##

> **_We value the principles of flow in our teams where engineers can achieve a state of full focus_**

## Agile ##

> **_We value the principles of Agile_**

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

## We Solve Problems with Code ##

> **_We arent afraid to throw work away or to write some code to help us solve a problem_**

## We use Fitness functions as a way of measuring and reasoning about our architecture ##

> **_just like we measure our products to gauge success we measure our code and architecture to protect our code_**

## Make it easiest to do the right thing ##

> **_Always enable colleagues to make the right decision by making it the easiest decision_**

## Technology decisions are owned by chapters ##

> **_Key decisions on platform specific technology and its use are decided by chapters_**

## We believe in total Quality ##

Quality From the start
Our quality standards are not negotiable

# Behaviours #

## We value transparency ##

> **_Transparency provides for a culture of trust and allows shared understanding_**

## We are inclusive by default ##

> **_We are equals as part of the same team_**

## Fairness and equality are paramount ##

## We value and support continual learning and development ##

> **_Self development and mastery is critical to our personal and mutual success_**

## We believe everyone is a coach ##Â 

> **_We help each other be our best through honest dialogue, advice and support _**
