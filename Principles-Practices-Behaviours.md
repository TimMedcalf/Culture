# Practices #

### Test Driven Development ###

    We value the practice of test-driven development
If you don't write the tests first will you write them afterwards?

Produces testable code by default

### Pairing and Pair Programming ###

    We value the practice of pair programming

Pair programming is pro-active code preview not fail-safe code reviews

Pair programming should be done at the right time for the right reasons.

Pair programming does not involve pairing all day, every day

Agree a pairing style and the scope of the work to be done when pairing

- [ ] **Rules defined**

### Work in small batches ###

    We work in small batches

small batches of work are easily verifiable, reduce risk and guide us towards continuous integration and delivery

Local Changes < 1 day old

### Review early and often ###

    We always aim to verify our work before the last moment

Clarify Specification and validate solution outline

use Pair programming

### Continuous delivery ###

    Our goal is continuous delivery

Small changes mean issues can be detected and fixed cheaply

deliver measurable outcomes quickly

feedback early and often

### Trunk Based Development ###

    Trunk based development supports our efforts in continuous delivery and ensures we can always release

We support longer term batches of work by using Feature Flags
and Branch by Abstraction

### Remote first ###

    We support remote workers as first class participants in any activity they are part of

A modern workforce should be enabled to work in a flexible way that supports their location and allows them an equal presence

### Spikes ###

    We use spikes to clarify feasibility and scope

Spikes are never on Master

We only use spokes on work that relates to user value

### Architectural decision records (ADRs) ###


### Mobbing ###

    We mob where significant technical exploration is required

### Code Review ###

    All of our code is reviewed

This is not necessarily a PR related review. This could be through pairing or through separate validation of work undertaken by someone on their own. Small batches is the key to keeping this an efficient practice.

## Principles ##

### SOLID ###

    We value the SOLID principles of object oriented programming

**S**ingle responsibility principle

**O**pen-closed principle

**L**iskow substitution principles

**I**nterface segregation principle

**D**ependency inversion principle


### Clean Architecture Principles ###

    Our Architectural values are represented by Clean Architecture Principles


### Visualise Work ###

    We visualise work so our progress is transparent

### Flow ###

    We aim for flow in our teams where engineers can achieve a state of full

    focus to ensure quality and best cater for thought workers

### Agile ###

    We value the principles of Agile

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

### Solve problems with code ###

    Be happy to throw it away

### Architectural Fitness ###

    just like we measure our products to gauge success we measure our code and
    architecture to protect our code

### Make it easiest to do the right thing ###

    Always enable colleagues to make the right decision by making it the easiest decision

### Technology decisions are owned by chapters ###



### Quality###

From the start
Not-negotiable
